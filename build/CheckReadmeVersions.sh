# Fails when README.md pins a package version that is not the one this repository currently
# builds. The install snippets are copy-paste starting points, and a hardcoded version there goes
# stale silently on every release - 3.14.0.1 sat in the snippets while 3.14.0.2 shipped. Running
# this in CI makes the version bump before a release drag the README along with it.
#
# What is checked: every <PackageReference Include="DatadogNet..." Version="..."> pin, the
# device-check example (run-simulator-tests.sh <version> ...), the dd-sdk-ios badge - which
# names the native version three times over: its label, the shields.io image path and the
# release link - and the "Built against **dd-sdk-ios N**" intro prose. Prose that explains the
# version *scheme* ("3.14.0.1 is dd-sdk-ios 3.14.0, binding revision 1") is deliberately not
# checked - it describes the format, not the current release - and the anchored patterns below
# do not reach the historical "dd-sdk-ios 3.0 deleted that framework" style of sentence either.
